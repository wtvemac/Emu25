This is WWWBoard Version 2.0 ALPHA 2

Te name was changed from WebBoard, because I found out O'Reilly has a 
copyright on that name.  Ooops!

That means that there are obviously going to be problems with it.. That's why 
its ALPHA.  If you find something you think is an error, or think of an option 
you would like added, please mail me at:

mattw@worldwidemart.com

Also.. If you implement this, I want to know so tht I can check up on how it 
is doing.  This way, you can also get notified when the next version is 
released.  you can easily register at:

http://worldwidemart.com/scripts/implement.html

Choose Bulletin Board Message System as what you are registering and then 
put ALPHA-2 as the version.

Let me know if you have any problems installing this?!
