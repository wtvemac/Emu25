# WebTV Server Emulator 2.5

This is an old server I built in the early 2000s when I was in high school. It's designed to allow a WebTV box (or viewer) to connect and experience what WNI offered with a local server.

It allows for multiple services, has a custom event language based on the mIRC scripting language and the ability to execute CGI commands.

This is meant for archival purposes. This hasn't been worked on in years. It's here for you to see my excellent programming and spelling skills.

I'd suggest you take a look at https://github.com/zefie/zefie_wtvp_minisrv if you want something more modern.
